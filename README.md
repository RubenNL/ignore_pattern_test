just a test to demonstrate home assistant supervisor not accepting `**` as ignore pattern.

the `*/a/b/**/f` ignore pattern doesn't work, but the other 2 work.

how to use: 

1. add repo to your installation(use https://github.com/RubenNL/ignore_pattern_test) as repo URL.
2. install addon
3. start addon
4. take snapshot of addon
5. inspect resulting tar file
